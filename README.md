# My-portfolio

This is my official portfolio for my Git Hub profile. I created this portfolio using Bootstrap. Inside, I have linked my contact information as well as links to deployed projects that I made through VS code. The first link is my project called [Sporting-Event-Finder](./assets/css/images/sport%20screenshot.jpg).
This application allows the user to obtain weather and sporting event data for a particular city on a specified day. You can access it here:

My second link goes to my [Work-Day-Scheduler](./assets/css/images/Planner%20screenshot.jpg). This application displays the current date and time of today. In addition, the user can input and store tasks that need to be done in the input fields. The fields will also change color based on the current time. You can access it here:

My third link goes to my [Password-Generator](./assets/css/images/Password%20Gen%20screenshot.jpg.) This application automatically generates a password for the user based on parameters that the user can select. You can access it here:
